# Delta_Parallel_Robot
Course Project - Kinematics of Machinery

##  Overview

This project involves the **design, modeling, and kinematic analysis** of a Delta-type parallel manipulator.
The work covers **CAD modeling in SolidWorks**, **MATLAB-based forward and inverse kinematics**, and **workspace analysis** with motion simulation.

The Delta robot is widely used in **high-speed pick-and-place** operations in industries due to its **high stiffness, precision, and low moving mass**.


##  Features

* **3D CAD Model** designed in *SolidWorks*.
* **Forward Kinematics** using vector-based approach.
* **Inverse Kinematics** using the half-angle trigonometric method.
* **MATLAB simulations** for motion profiles (position & velocity).
* **Animation** of the robot motion from SolidWorks.
